# SwapLayer secure development

SwapLayer applies the intent of the NIST Secure Software Development Framework
(SSDF) to a small provider-integration library.

## Practices

- **Prepare:** maintain the threat model, ownership boundaries, disclosure
  process, protected CI permissions, and documented release criteria.
- **Protect:** require least-privilege workflows, commit-pinned actions, hashed
  release tooling, trusted publishing, protected environments, and reviewed
  changes on `main`.
- **Produce:** test every provider with mocks and SDK response objects, test
  storage scoping and key validation with hostile paths, keep credentials out
  of logs, errors, and MCP output, bound provider calls with timeouts, and mark
  MCP tools that send, write, or change provider state as not read-only.
- **Respond:** triage privately, contain critical issues rapidly, revoke or
  rotate affected trust, issue patched releases and advisories, and capture
  lessons in tests and the threat model.

## Security-sensitive changes

Every security-relevant change must identify the affected assets and trust
boundaries, include negative tests, and consider compatibility and migration.
No generated or AI-assisted change is exempt from human review and the same
checks. Do not weaken a bound, error mode, audit behavior, signature check, or
release gate solely to preserve compatibility.

Review these areas with particular care: storage key validation and tenant
scoping, webhook signature verification, credential handling and redaction,
HTTP timeouts and retries, token caching, provider SDK upgrades, and MCP
tools that send or write.

## Repository controls

These GitHub settings were in place on 2026-11-10:

- `main` accepts pushes only from the owner and rejects force pushes and
  deletion. Other changes need a pull request approved by the code owner, with
  stale approvals dismissed and conversations resolved.
- Release tags (`v*`) can be created only by repository administrators, and no
  one can move or delete them.
- The `pypi` environment accepts only `main` and `v*` tags, requires the
  owner's approval, and does not let administrators bypass it. PyPI uploads use
  Trusted Publishing with short-lived OIDC credentials.
- Every workflow is manual (`workflow_dispatch`) and runs only when the owner
  starts it, with actions pinned to full commit SHAs and read-only default
  permissions. Pull requests, issues, and comments cannot start a workflow.
  GitHub's Dependabot jobs run weekly on their own and only open pull requests.
- Workflows can use only the actions on the repository's allowlist, each at one
  commit SHA. Before merging a Dependabot pull request that moves an action to a
  new SHA, the owner adds the new SHA to the allowlist, together with any action
  the new version itself uses.
- Secret scanning with push protection, private vulnerability reporting, and
  Dependabot alerts, security updates, and weekly version updates are on.

Known gaps: the project has one maintainer, so no second person reviews the
owner's changes, and the owner can push to `main` directly. No status checks
are required, because CI runs only when the owner starts it, and commits are
not required to be signed. Export these settings with each audit.
